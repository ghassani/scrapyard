# Experimentation in QCDM / CDMA Provisioning

Maybe someone can learn from this.

It works.. somewhat. Connect a CDMA phone with drivers installed and you can perform basic read operations. No write operations are supported. Sorta modled after CDMA Workshop - this was just something I was curious about and got into for a short while.

I got some insight from libqcdm from ModemManager, cdmaworkshoptool AKA CDMADevTerm, as well as some chinese sources on the web and that got me started on this now abandoned project.
